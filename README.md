# RabidWarren.Binding Example Program

This provides an example of using RabidWarren.Binding, a Property framework
which is implemented in a Portable Class Library.

The example itself is simple.  There are three TextBoxes.  The first is
bound to a numeric value, the second is bound to a string.  The third is
shows an example which is computed from the first two.

One interesting feature of the example is that it uses RabidWarren.Binding's
expression composition features to simplify binding WPF TextBoxes.
